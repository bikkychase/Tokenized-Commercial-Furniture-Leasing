# Tokenized Commercial Furniture Leasing

This repository contains a blockchain-based solution for managing commercial furniture leasing through tokenization. The platform creates a transparent, efficient ecosystem for furniture providers and business clients to engage in leasing arrangements with reduced friction and enhanced accountability.

## System Architecture

The platform is built around four essential smart contracts:

1. **Inventory Registration Contract**: Tokenizes and catalogs available commercial furniture with detailed specifications
2. **Client Verification Contract**: Implements KYC processes to validate and onboard qualified business customers
3. **Lease Agreement Contract**: Manages the complete lifecycle of furniture lease agreements with automated enforcement
4. **Condition Tracking Contract**: Records and monitors the physical condition of leased items throughout the rental period

## Key Features

- Digital representation (NFTs) of physical furniture assets
- Automated lease agreement execution and enforcement
- Transparent record of furniture condition throughout lease cycles
- Simplified security deposit management and returns
- Streamlined onboarding process for business clients
- Complete lease history for regulatory compliance
- Automated billing and payment processing
- Condition-based maintenance scheduling
